## Omy_Klamath_2024
## Objective: Use genotyping-in-thousands (GT-seq) to characterize fine-scale neutral and adaptive genetic diversity of Oncorhynchus mykiss in the Klamath Basin before dam removal. 
## Final product: Manuscript in prep.
## quality_HWE_LD_filtering: R markdown html records of genotype quality filtering, sampling location pooling, and filtering for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) and linkage disequilibrium (LD). 
## analyses: R markdown html records of principal components analysis (PCA), STRUCTURE analysis, genotype frequency estimates of markers associated with resident - anadromous phenotypes (i.e., Omy-5 on chromosome 5) and adult return timing (i.e., Omy-28 on chromosome 28), and temporal genetic differentiation in sites with past and contemporary sampling.
